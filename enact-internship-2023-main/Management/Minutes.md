# Date : June 2nd, 2023 at 10:00am (online(Email))
Decisions made in the meeting:

1. It was decided that instead of presenting at the E4C Intern's Day Seminar, I will shift my focus to the technical aspects of the Gin tool. This entails gaining a more comprehensive understanding of the tool's code.

2. As part of regular progress updates, I will provide a weekly report to my supervisors, detailing the tasks and activities accomplished throughout the week.

# Date : June 16th, 2023 at 8:20am (online)
Decisions made in the meeting:

1. It was determined that there is an issue with the configuration of the "LocalSearch.java" class in the "gin" package. The class functions correctly in the Eclipse IDE but encounters problems when executed in the command line. I will investigate and identify the configuration error, specifically related to class path and dependencies, causing the discrepancy in behavior between the Eclipse IDE and the command line environment.

2. It is advised that I need to maintain regular and consistent communication with supervisors, ensuring timely updates and sharing the output of the task related to the GIN tool problem.

3. Based on the provided output, the next steps will be defined to address and resolve the issues identified in the GIN tool, taking into consideration the specific details and observations from the output. 

# Date : June 23th, 2023 at 01:00pm (online)
Decisions made in the meeting:

1. It was decided that to complete the execution for all commands that mentioned in GIN repository's https://github.com/gintool/gin README file's "Full Example with a Maven Project" section and need to analyze all the steps that mentioned in the section. I need to collect all the inforamtion about this gin tool's experiment running(Full Example with a Maven Project) in the internhsip report in latex. 

2. In the background section of the inernship report in latex, I need to add a new section named "Genetic Improvement". In this secton i will descrive what does mean by genetic improvement, how can we reuse this etc. In the subsection, I will introduce the "Gin Toolbox" and discuss the "process" of gin tool that I read in the paper. I will explain the process and class diagram.

3. I need to add subjections in "chapter 3". In subjection 3.1, "Experimental executions using JoularJX" I will introduce "mandelbrot" single java program experiment and "cMath_original" project experiment. I need to descrive the result that I found and need to descrive little bit about the single java program(algorithm) and the project. I need to discuss how anyone can run this experiment and how many execution defined for observing the result.  

4. I will introduce an other subjection 3.2 "Experimental executions using Gin". It will have 3 subsubsections. In 3.2.1 subsubsection "Running a Simple Example: Triangle" I will discuss in this section what command lines i followed, what is the purpose of those command lines, what modification I did during the experiment, what result i found after the experiment, why i need this experiment.

5. In 3.2.2 subsubsection "Full Example with a Maven Project: spatial4j", I will discuss what versions and dependencies necessary to run this experiment, what I modified in the pom.xml file, what steps (command line) I followed for running this experiment, what is the purpose for this command line, what information gather from this experiment, what is the result for each steps(profilling, patching, etc). I was suggested by Denisse Mam, to start this section because right now i am working on this experiment. 

6. In 3.2.3 subsubsection "Experimental executions using JoularJX for patchs given by Gin", I will discuss the experiment of the "Runnning JoularJX in the spatial4j ORIGINAL project (30 executions) -> time execution"
and "Running JoularJX in the spatial4j OPTIMISED project (30 executions) -> time execution". Finally compare if there is any difference between the original and optimised versions of "spatial4j wrt energy. -> Wilcoxon Test".  

7. I will need add another subsection 3.3 "Integrating code refactoring to Gin". Here, I will discuss reagrding the Integratigation of at least 1 code refactoring for energy saving to Gin. Based on this integration I will run experiments and add all the inforamtion regarding the experiment and result. 

8. It is advised that I need to maintain regular and consistent communication with supervisors, ensuring timely updates and sharing the output of the task. 


# Date: June 30th, 2023 at 11:30 am (Physical at ENSIIE)
Decisions made in the meeting:

1. In the meeting, we discussed regarding the presentation which will be held on the 3rd July and 4th July.

2. It was decided that I need to update the slides based on the feedback provided by Madam Denisse.

3. I also need to adopt all the slides on the ShareLaTeX platform for the presentation and update my speech based on the feedback provided by Madam Denisse.

# Date: July 5th, 2023 at 10:00 am (online)
Decisions made in the meeting:

1. In the meeting, we discussed the problem I faced with the Gin tool for executing the "Full Example with a Maven Project" using Gin tool.

2. We tried to run the "Full Example with a Maven Project (GitHub: https://github.com/gintool/gin)" experiment, but it was not working for the "Run EmptyPatchTester" section. Then we checked it in one IDE (Eclipse), and it was running in this IDE without showing any error. Then we checked the configuration and dependencies for the project and also added the dependencies classpath in the command, but the same problem occurred.

3. Finally, it was suggested to complete the report's two sections (Experimental executions using JoularJX, and Experimental executions using Gin).


# Date : July 6th, 2023 at 4:00pm (online)
Decisions made in the meeting:

1. During the meeting, it was discussed that I need to find a solution to the problem I encountered while attempting to execute the "Full Example with a Maven Project." My task is to determine how I can resolve this issue and obtain the optimized version of the project using the gin tool. Once I have obtained the optimized version, I am required to compare it with the original version using JoularJX. This step will pave the way for further actions.

2. I am expected to continue working on the report. In addition to conducting the technical experiment, I should simultaneously complete all the sections of the report.

3. It was advised that I should provide a weekly progress report on my work.

# Date : July 13th, 2023 at 5:00pm to 5:30pm (online)
Decisions made in the meeting:

1. During the meeting, I received a suggestion to work on the bibliography. Papers related to Gin were provided to me to update the background study.

2. I presented the completed sections of the internship report in the meeting.

3. It was suggested to conduct a comparison using the Wilcoxon test between the original Triangle program and the optimized Triangle program using Joularjx.


# Date : August 2nd, 2023 at 1:00pm to 1:50pm (presential)
Decisions made in the meeting:

1. During the meeting, it was suggested that I update the multicriteria fitness functions of the Gin tool to obtain an optimized version of the program. For this update, I will need to use the NSGAII algorithm to optimize the program based on multicriteria fitness.

2. Subsequently, I need to add a table comparing the energy consumption of programs optimized by the single fitness function and the multicriteria fitness function. From this comparison, we will conclude which one is more energy efficient.

3. We have another meeting on Friday, where we will discuss another example, like Triangle, in the context of the current work. Following that, we will focus on project optimization based on the single fitness function and the multicriteria fitness function. 

# Date : August 9th, 2023 at 2:00pm to 2:50pm (presential)
Decisions made in the meeting:

1. Update on Fitness Comparison:
   - It was decided to revise the table comparing single-criteria fitness and multi-criteria fitness. 
   - The update will involve comparing execution time fitness, memory consumption fitness, and a combination of both, showing the percentage reduction in energy consumption in the optimized version.
   - Confidence percentages for all energy consumption experiment's mean values will be included.
   - Detailed analysis and definitive answers will be provided regarding the experiment's impact on energy reduction.

2. Conclusion and Future Work Chapters:
   - Work needs to be conducted on the conclusion chapter, summarizing the findings and results.
   - In the Future Work chapter, detailed plans will be laid out on integrating code refactoring into the gin tool, including necessary steps to achieve this goal.
