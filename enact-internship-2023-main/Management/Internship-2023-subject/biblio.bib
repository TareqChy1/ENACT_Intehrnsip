abstract = {We created detailed profiles of the energy consumed by common operations done on Java List, Map, and Set abstractions. The results show that the alternative data types for these abstractions differ significantly in terms of energy consumption depending on the operations. For example, an ArrayList consumes less energy than a LinkedList if items are inserted at the middle or at the end, but consumes more energy than a LinkedList if items are inserted at the start of the list. To explain the results, we explored the memory usage and the bytecode executed during an operation. Expensive computation tasks in the analyzed bytecode traces appeared to have an energy impact, but memory usage did not contribute. We evaluated our profiles by using them to selectively replace Collections types used in six applications and libraries. We found that choosing the wrong Collections type, as indicated by our profiles, can cost even 300% more energy than the most efficient choice. Our work shows that the usage context of a data structure and our measured energy profiles can be used to decide between alternative Collections implementations.},

abstract = {Context: Quality attributes play a critical role in the architecture elicitation phase. Software Sustainability and energy efficiency is becoming a critical quality attribute that can be used as a selection criteria to choose from among different design or implementation alternatives. Energy efficiency usually competes with other non-functional requirements, like for instance, performance. Objective: This paper presents a process that helps developers to automatically generate optimum configurations of functional quality attributes in terms of energy efficiency and performance. Functional quality attributes refer to the behavioral properties that need to be incorporated inside a software architecture to fulfill a particular quality attribute (e.g., encryption and authentication for the security quality attribute, logging for the usability quality attribute). Method: Quality attributes are characterized to identify their design and implementation variants and how the different configurations influence both energy efficiency and performance. A usage model for each characterized quality attribute is defined. The variability of quality attributes, as well as the energy efficiency and performance experiment results, are represented as a constraint satisfaction problem with the goal of formally reasoning about it. Then, a configuration of the selected functional quality attributes is automatically generated, which is optimum with respect to a selected objective function. Results: Software developers can improve the energy efficiency and/or performance of their applications by using our approach to perform a richer analysis of the energy consumption and performance of different alternatives for functional quality attributes. We show quantitative values of the benefits of using our approach and discuss the threats to validity. Conclusions: The process presented in this paper will help software developers to build more energy efficient software, whilst also being aware of how their decisions affect other quality attributes, such as performance.}

abstract = {Software systems have a strong impact on the energy consumption of the hardware they use. This is especially important for cyber-physical systems where power consumption strongly influences the battery life. For this reason, software developers should be more aware of the energy consumed by their systems. Moreover, software systems should be developed to adapt their behavior to minimize the energy consumed during their execution. This can be done by monitoring the usage context of the system and having runtime support to react to those changes that impact the energy footprint negatively. Although both the hardware and the software parts of cyber-physical systems can be adapted to reduce its energy consumption, this paper focuses on software adaptation. Concretely, the paper illustrates how to address the problem of developing context-aware energy-efficient applications using a Green Eco-Assistant that makes use of advanced software engineering methods, such as Dynamic Software Product Lines and Separation of Concerns. The main steps of our approach are illustrated by applying them to a cyber-physical system case study.}

Such environments are characterized by heterogeneous devices, often employing diverse communication technologies with varying energy consumption, discovery ranges, and transmission rates. These complexities pose a daunting setting for the development of IoT applications that could leverage direct communication with proximal mobile and embedded devices. While current approaches focus either on device discovery in the IoT setting or content transfer assuming established communication channels, none facilitate the intelligent discovery of useful devices and the seamless formation of temporary D2D connections to transfer content directly between devices. Our Omni middleware provides both of these features critical in the development of applications that leverage proximal devices in IoT settings. Using Omni, we demonstrate the feasibility of building applications that use heterogeneous D2D communication channels in an efficient and realistic (in terms of energy and time) manner.},

abstract = {Background - Since sustainability became a challenge in software engineering, researchers mainly from requirements engineering and software architecture communities have contributed to defining the basis of the notion of sustainability-aware software.
Problem - Despite these valuable efforts, the assessment and design based on the notion of sustainability as a software quality is still poorly understood. There is no consensus on which sustainability requirements should be considered.
Aim and Method - To fill this gap, a survey was designed with a double objective: i) determine to which extent quality requirements contribute to the sustainability of software-intensive systems; and ii) identify direct dependencies among the sustainability dimensions. The survey involved different target audiences (e.g. software architects, ICT practitioners with expertise in Sustainability). We evaluated the perceived importance/relevance of each sustainability dimension, and the perceived usefulness of exploiting a sustainability model in different software engineering activities.
Results - Most respondents considered modifiability as relevant for addressing both technical and environmental sustainability. Functional correctness, availability, modifiability, interoperability and recoverability favor positively the endurability of software systems. This study has also identified security, satisfaction, and freedom from risk as very good contributors to social sustainability. Satisfaction was also considered by the respondents as a good contributor to economic sustainability.}

    abstract = {Motivation: Software systems as we know them often have a economic purpose and/or fulfill human or social needs of their users. The economic purpose is analysed by economy itself; the latter goals are analysed in software engineering by user-centric techniques, such as service orientation. Yet, as software systems have an impact on the environment, environmental sustainability should be supported as a major goal for software development projects.Problem: Without applicable guidance, sustainability remains an untangible ideal. Therefore, we need a definition and a concrete decomposition of sustainability to relate it to software systems development. It is not sufficient to analyse environmental sustainbility on its own, but its interplay with other aspects in order to define appropriate actions and understand their effects.Principal idea: We analyse the dimensions of sustainability, their values with respective indicators, and activities to support them. These elements compose a conceptual model that allows for analysing and constructing actions both for a company or a product point of view.Contribution: We propose a generic sustainability model with instances for companies and projects from various case studies. We thus enable analysis, support and assessment of environmental sustainability in software engineering.},
